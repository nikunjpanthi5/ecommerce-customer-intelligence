E-commerce Customer Intelligence & Behavior-Based Targeting System

 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Data Analytics and Data Science solution designed to analyze customer behavior in an e-commerce platform, identify valuable customer segments, predict churn, estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), and enable behavior-based targeting (e.g., discount-driven vs. regular buyers).

The project follows real-world industry practices, using raw transactional data and a full analytics pipeline involving SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI/Tableau, Git, and AWS (optional).

 🎯 Business Problem

E-commerce companies face challenges such as:

* High customer acquisition cost
* Customers purchasing only during discounts or free delivery
* Inability to identify churn-risk users early
* Lack of customer-level targeting strategies

This project helps businesses answer:

* Who are the most valuable customers?
* Which customers are likely to churn?
* Which customers respond only to discounts or free delivery?
* How should marketing offers be personalized?

 🧠 Key Objectives

* Analyze customer purchase behavior using transactional data
* Segment customers based on RFM and behavioral patterns
* Predict customer churn using machine learning models
* Estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
* Build interactive dashboards for business decision-making
